## ‚úÖ Scenario 1: Customer Support Chatbot

**Goal**: Fast, responsive replies for user queries at low cost

**Inputs**:

* Model: 7B
* Tokens: 300
* Batch Size: 8
* Hardware: T4
* Deployment Mode: Cloud

**Results**:

* Latency: \~0.3s
* Memory Usage: \~17.6 GB
* Cost per Request: \~\$0.0012
* Hardware Compatible: ‚úÖ

**Recommendation**: Great balance of performance and cost. Ideal for production-grade bots.

## üìÑ Scenario 2: Document Summarization Pipeline

**Goal**: Summarize long documents (1500+ tokens) on demand

**Inputs**:

* Model: 13B
* Tokens: 1500
* Batch Size: 4
* Hardware: A100
* Deployment Mode: Cloud

**Results**:

* Latency: \~1.875s
* Memory Usage: \~28.8 GB
* Cost per Request: \~\$0.0075
* Hardware Compatible: ‚úÖ

**Recommendation**: A100 is suitable for larger input size and 13B model. GPT-4 is overkill for this case.

## üß† Scenario 3: Educational App on Local Laptop

**Goal**: Run inference offline on user device

**Inputs**:

* Model: 7B
* Tokens: 500
* Batch Size: 1
* Hardware: RTX 4090
* Deployment Mode: Local

**Results**:

* Latency: \~0.625s
* Memory Usage: \~16.2 GB
* Cost per Request: \$0.0 (local)
* Hardware Compatible: ‚úÖ

**Recommendation**: Perfect fit. 7B runs smoothly on RTX 4090 with no hosting cost.
